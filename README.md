# ECE 231 Week 1 - GitHub

This week I want you to start using and understanding git and GitHub because GitHub will
be how you will turn in all of your assignments going forward. GitHub has several short
training videos and exercises which I want you to go through and watch or complete this week.

### First C++ program

Using git, clone this repository to your machine. Using vim or the program editor of your choice, create
a file "hello.cpp" which should be a C++ source file for the standard "hello, world" program. Except instead
of just printing out Hello, world!, I want the program to tell me about you - who you are, where you came from,
what you are hoping to get out of this class, and where you want to go in life. Also, add a Makefile that will
compile the program by just typing "make". Once your program runs, add it to git, commit it to your local
repsoitory, and then push it to this GitHub repository.  The push is important! That's how you turn in your
completed assignment.
